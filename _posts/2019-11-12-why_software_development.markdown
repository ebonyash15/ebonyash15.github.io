Lately I have been repeatedly asked the big question, "why are you here?" I tried thrice before to go to college, and thrice before I have failed. But in the programming world failing just means you need to tweak the code and try again-- that's what I'm  doing.

I have to work full-time to provide for myself and my son. Daycare hours really limit how much time I can spend at work or on a campus so I had given up on college. Banking is great for my current situation but I have goals that involve getting out of customer service so I need to get an education. 

Intro to Engineering covered a lot of computer programming through MatLab, being the only class I finished in my previous endeavors with higher education, I felt engineering would be a good goal. I looked for online classes for engineering so that I could do schooling even when I couldn't find a babysitter. Software engineering is a strong base for many different industries and feilds so it was exciting to find advertisements for FlatIron School.

Suddenly, the timing for higher education was no longer a viable excuse. FlatIron even offered a free online Software Eengineering Bootcamp so that I could get a feel for my compatablility with the field. The material was challenging but encouraging and I consumed it with a hunger as though the muses had a grip on me. 

Halfway through the bootcamp it requires applying for a program. I had an opprotunity before me to develop a skill set to qualify for much better paying (and mentally engaging) careers and decided to take the plunge.

So, "why software development?" To increase my job satisfaction and quality of life by uncovering a lucrative manifestation for my passion of problemsolving.
