This was especially difficult for  me compared to the previous lessons as I struggle greatly with scraping. I managed to get it done in the nick of time and now there is a CLI gem to get suggestions for animes from popular studios according to Anime-Planet.com!

Many resources for scraping and CLI configuration are available online. For this project I used previous lessons in the course curriculum, youtube walk-throughs from FlatIron School employees and other people, previous submissions of similar assignments and good old-fashioned google-ing.

Once you have the resources, tools, and information you need to inspire your work you need to actually get down to the nitty gritty.

I hit a wall that had me stumped for days trying to fine-tune my scraping in the downloaded Learn-IDE sandbox. I tried to build my CLI from userface back to data, following the video walk-throughs I found available but it wasn't clicking for me.  I found it much easier to pick a site and scrape all of the information that I could, labelling it as I went along, and then finding a way to format it and make it relevant to a user. There is no "right" way to approach a problem, but if you are stuck I highly recommend turning your approach on its head to get a new view of the situation.

Speaking of new views, what you physically see can help with a block as well. If you feel burnt out on this problem but it needs done now, look at it with a different layout, font-type, or font-color! It helps break up the monotony of working on the same piece of code for a long period of time. You may also just need to give your eyes a rest and walk around a bit. When I paused to go get a snack or rotate laundry I often thought of another approach before I even made it where I was headed. Though it was hard to remember to stop and update my file and push to Git-Hub, I found that the side-by-side view of Repl.it was incredibly helpful for testing my code in a similar fashion to putting binding pry at the end of a file. 

I highly recommend using a different color, layout, or approach to work through a creator's block! It may be unconventional but every great and revolutionary creation was.
